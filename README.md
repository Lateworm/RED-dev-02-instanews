# Instanews Web App
RED Academy Web Development Project 02

## Dev Tasks
- Refine the layout to get it as close as possible to to comps
- The logo and chooser seems to shift again on the second load.
- Test cross-browser
- Incorporate a <select> field with custom styles applied (you will need a jQuery plugin for this such as Selectric)
- Incorporate a combination of jQuery and CSS3-based animation to animate the movement of the header on the <select> change
- Use CSS3 transitions to show and hide the article abstract on hover
- Re-export the loading spinner with anti-aliasing
- Try a different CSS Reset
- Switch to full Sass syntax
- Prevent the creation of extra spans at the bottom of the DOM.

## Project Notes
		// try filtering the data before we begin looping
		// var data = rawData.results; // this can be used to refine the dataset
		// hints: .fiter() and .slice()

		// $.each(data, function(index, value) {
		// 	var example = 'each loop';
		// });

		// var += more stuff to append

		// if no media present,
		// return true;
